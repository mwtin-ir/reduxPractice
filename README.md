#  Redux Toolkit & RTK Query Practice Project
This is a simple project created to strengthen my skills in Redux, specifically using Redux Toolkit and RTK Query, along with React Router DOM for navigation and Tailwind CSS for styling. The goal of this project is to implement state management using modern Redux tools, add routing functionality, and apply responsive design using Tailwind CSS.

## Features
- Redux Toolkit for simplified Redux store setup
- RTK Query for efficient data fetching and caching
- React Router DOM for managing navigation between different pages
- Tailwind CSS for modern and responsive UI styling
- Actions and reducers for managing application state
- Async state management using RTK Query for API calls
- Dynamic page routing and navigation
- Demonstration of state updates, routing, and UI reactivity
- Getting Started
- To run the project locally:

### `Clone the repository:`

```
git clone https://github.com/mwtin-ir/reduxPractice.git
```
## `Install the dependencies:`


```
npm install
```

### `Start the development server:`
```
npm start
```

The project will be available at http://localhost:3000.

## Technologies Used
- React: Frontend library for building user interfaces
- Redux Toolkit: Simplified Redux setup with enhanced tools
- RTK Query: A powerful data fetching and caching tool built into Redux Toolkit
- React Router DOM: For adding navigation and dynamic routing between pages
- Tailwind CSS: Utility-first CSS framework for building modern, responsive designs
- JavaScript (ES6+): For writing the application logic
## Learning Goals
- Understand the core concepts of Redux Toolkit (slices, store, etc.)
- Efficiently manage state with Redux Toolkitâ€™s createSlice
- Perform API requests using RTK Query and handle server data
- Implement client-side routing using React Router DOM
- Create responsive and modern UIs with Tailwind CSS
- Practice best practices in managing global state with Redux
- Improve performance through automatic caching and data synchronization using RTK Query
## Future Improvements
- Expand state management with more complex slices and actions
- Implement error handling and loading states with RTK Query
- Add unit tests for Redux slices and RTK Query hooks
- Implement route guards and dynamic routing in React Router DOM
- Improve the design further with custom Tailwind CSS components
